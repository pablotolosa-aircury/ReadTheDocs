# Create Documentation

You have to create your documentation in MD format in order to be recognized by ReadTheDocs.

The documentation must be in the "docs" folder that MkDocs generated.

You can check this website to learn more about MD format:

- MarkDown [syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

Once you have your documentation done and located on the docs folder you can go to he next step.
