# Create Documentation

You have to create your documentation in .rst format in order to be recognized by ReadTheDocs.
You have to ways to do it: 

- Write the documentation in MD format and use this [website](https://cloudconvert.com/md-to-rst) to convert it to RST.
- Write the documentation directly in RST format.

The documentation must be in the "docs" folder that MkDocs generated.

You can check this website to learn more about MD and RST formats:
