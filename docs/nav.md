# Navigation Menu

We have to go to he mkdocs.yml file to create the navigation menu.


You must follow this structure:

    nav:
        - (name of the section) : (name of your document) 

Here is how the menu of this documentation is done:

    nav:
    - Introduction: 'index.md'
    - First steps: 'firstSteps.md'
    - Create Documentation: 'createDocumentation.md'
    - Navigation Menu: 'nav.md'
    - Upload Documentation: 'uploadDocumentation.md'
