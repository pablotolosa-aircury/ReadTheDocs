# Navigation Menu

We have to go to he mkdocs.yml file to create the navigation menu.

You must follow this structure: 

    ..toctree::
        :caption: (Section Title)

        example    

"example" is the name of your RST file that you want to put on that section.

Here is how the menu of this documentation is done:

    ..toctree::
        :caption: Home

        index

    ..toctree::
        :caption: First steps
    
        firstSteps

    ..toctree::
        :caption: Create Documentation

        createDocumentation

    ..toctree::
        :caption: Navigation Menu

        nav

    ..totctree::
        :caption: Upload Documentation

        uploadDocumentation
